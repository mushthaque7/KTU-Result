Whenever KTU publishes a result, the site will be broken within minutes.In order to solve this problem , I created the result viewer. It help to view your result.

  git clone https://github.com/mushthaque7/KTU-Result.git
```
Go to the project directory

```bash
  cd KTU-Result
```

  npm run dev
```
